# batch-colourise-deepai
 A small Python script to batch colourise photos with the deepAI API, which uses Jason Antic's model.
 https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/colorizer
 
 todo:
 
 -overlay colour from colourised image onto original full res image for better resolution
 
 -select folder instead of putting script in it
 
 -select only individual file mode
 
 -only overlay color mode
 
 -local file input sanitization when selecting files
 
 -proper gui
 
 -one day maybe use DeOldify locally instead of using API (far away)
